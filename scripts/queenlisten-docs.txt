The Queen listen service intercepts return files from drones and saves to tmp.
This is necessary when a command is sent to multiple drones simultaneously.

To add the service:
sudo mv /home/player1/primecam_readout/scripts/queenlisten.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable queenlisten.service
sudo systemctl start queenlisten.service

To check the status:
sudo systemctl status queenlisten.service

If you modify or otherwise need to restart:
sudo systemctl restart queenlisten.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

To modify in place:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/queenlisten.service
