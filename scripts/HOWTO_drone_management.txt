Drones are be managed by systemd are the RFSoC boards.

To set this up initially, move the service file to the systemd directory:
cp drone@.service /etc/systemd/system/

Make sure the drone script can run without sudo:
sudo visudo
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl start drone@*.service, /bin/systemctl stop drone@*.service, /bin/systemctl restart drone@*.service

Then enable all 4 drone services:
sudo systemctl enable drone@1.service
sudo systemctl enable drone@2.service
sudo systemctl enable drone@3.service
sudo systemctl enable drone@4.service

Start the drones as follows:
sudo systemctl start drone@1.service
sudo systemctl start drone@2.service
sudo systemctl start drone@3.service
sudo systemctl start drone@4.service

Basic controls to start, stop, restart, and get status:
sudo systemctl start drone@1.service
sudo systemctl stop drone@1.service
sudo systemctl restart drone@1.service
sudo systemctl status drone@1.service
