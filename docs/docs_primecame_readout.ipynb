    "primecam_readout is (primarily) python software to mediate communication between multiple parallel operating RFSoC boards, each running an RF network of KIDs, and their central control computer. The RFSoC boards control readout operations for many of the modules on the PrimeCam instrument on the FYST telescope in the CCAT facility/collaboration. Development was begun in January 2022. The software's main goals are to (1) control and drive the readout, in tandem with the gateware, to produce timestreams and calibration data, and (2) provide interfaces to said control. "
