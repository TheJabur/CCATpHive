    "CCATpHive is python software to mediate communication between the control server and the parallel operating RFSoC boards which control readout operations for the CCAT Prime telescope. Development was begun in January 2022. The software's main goals are: (1) to provide interface hooks (and a terminal interface) to board functionality; (2) to integrate with a Redis server to communicate over a network between the control server and the boards; (3) to provide control of the main readout functionality scripts. \n",
