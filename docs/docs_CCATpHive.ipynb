    "CCATpHive is python software to mediate communication between the control server and the parallel operating RFSoC boards which control readout operations for the CCAT Prime telescope. Development was begun in January 2022. The software's main goals are: (1) to provide interface hooks (and a terminal interface) to board functionality; (2) to integrate with a Redis server to communicate over a network between the control server and the boards; (3) to provide control of the main readout functionality scripts.

    "\n",
    "As of June 2022, a basic working version which accomplishes the 3 goals was complete including the ability to send commands from the control server to the boards via Redis and receive a return string, logging, basic configuration, and module integration to allow for board functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In July and August additional functionality was integrated in to provide command arguments, return payloads, separation of the board into 4 drones (each controlling an RF network), key/value pairs, and a proof of concept GUI. \n",
    "\n",
    "As of September 1st, the single channel module (single_chan) has rudimentary versions of the following functions: writeVnaComb, writeTestTone, getAdcData, getSnapData, vnaSweep, findResonators.\n",
