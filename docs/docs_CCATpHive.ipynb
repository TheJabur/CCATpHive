    "CCATpHive is python software to mediate communication between the control server and the parallel operating RFSoC boards which control readout operations for the CCAT/FYST telescope. Development was begun in January 2022. The software's main goals are to (1) provide interface hooks (and a terminal and graphical interface) to control computer and board functionality, (2) to automate the process of controlling the readout."
